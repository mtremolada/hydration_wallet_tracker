# hydration_wallet_tracker
A Telegram bot that tracks wallets on Hydration in order to copy trade

I exported the working bot from Replit and deleted my bot keys

I think all you need to do to run it yourself is replace the INSERT_TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY part with your key and then upload the zip to Replit or run locally.
